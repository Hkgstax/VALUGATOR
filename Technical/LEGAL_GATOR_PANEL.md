# Legal Gator Panel

## Document ID
[DOC-TECH-LGAL-1]

### ‚öñÔ∏è Purpose

The Legal Gator Panel exists to help users **critically assess legal risks, obligations, and IP considerations** in the early ideation and planning stages of their project. These characters simulate seasoned legal perspectives from different domains ‚Äî intellectual property, contracts, ethics, corporate formation, and international law.

They are **truth-driven**, not theatrical. Their role is to raise awareness of **hidden legal exposure, licensing flaws, and structural risks** users may overlook. They do not provide actual legal advice and must not be treated as legal counsel.

>
> Their critiques are for **educational and analytical purposes only**.  
> You must consult with a **licensed legal professional, law firm, or jurisdictionally authorized entity** before making any legal decisions, entering into agreements, or acting on any guidance provided within VALUGATOR.
