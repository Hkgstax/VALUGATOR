## Overview
This document catalogs common scenarios where the Pathfinder Council provides guidance to users facing internal challenges, decision paralysis, emotional obstacles, or strategic uncertainty in their startup journey. Each scenario includes a real-world builder profile, the specific Pathfinders that would be engaged, and their approach to providing illumination rather than evaluation.

## Purpose
The scenario library serves multiple purposes:
1. Illustrates how Pathfinders work in practice across different user needs
2. Provides reference patterns for dialogue generation
3. Helps users understand when and how to engage with the Pathfinder Council
4. Informs the development of guidance protocols and character interactions

## Scenario Structure
Each scenario is documented with the following elements:
- **Scenario Title**: The user's presenting challenge or question
- **Real-World Builder Profile**: Characteristics of users likely to face this challenge
- **Pathfinder Engagement**: Which Pathfinders would be involved and their approach
- **Coverage Assessment**: Analysis of how well the scenario is addressed by existing Pathfinders
- **Potential Enhancements**: Optional Pathfinder specializations that could improve guidance

âœ… Excellent for emotional grounding and direction resetting  
ðŸŸ¡ Potential Enhancement: A *"Feedback Forensics"* Pathfinder could analyze the *quality and source* of the critique.

### ðŸ§ª SCENARIO 3: *"I shipped something. No one cares."*

#### Real-World Builder Profile:

## Implementation Considerations

### Dialogue Generation Parameters
- Each scenario requires specialized dialogue flows with appropriate emotional arcs
- Pathfinders should demonstrate both individual character consistency and adaptive responses
- Conversations should build toward actionable insight, not just emotional comfort

### Visual and Interactive Elements
- Scenario-specific visual cues could aid user understanding (journey maps, decision trees)
- Interactive elements might help users engage with Pathfinder guidance (reflection prompts, visualization exercises)
- Session recordings could track user progress through recurring challenges

### Future Expansion
- The scenario library should grow based on user feedback and common patterns
- New Pathfinder specializations could be developed to address scenario gaps
- Cross-scenario patterns should inform the development of guidance protocols
