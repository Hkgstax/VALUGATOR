## Overview

This document outlines the various ways users interact with the VALUGATOR multi-panel system throughout their startup journey. It describes different entry points, journey paths, panel transitions, and integration points between panels, replacing the previous single-track evaluation-focused user experience.

## User Entry Points

Users can enter the VALUGATOR ecosystem through any of these entry points based on their current needs:

| Entry Point | Primary Panel | Typical User Need | Entry Trigger |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Idea Evaluation | Evaluation Chamber | "Is my idea viable?" | User requests feedback on concept or pitch |
| Strategic Guidance | Pathfinder Council | "What direction should I take?" | User seeks guidance on business/technical decisions |
| Risk Assessment | Legal Gator Panel | "What legal concerns should I address?" | User requests legal perspective on idea or implementation |
| General Assistance | System Router | "I need help with my startup" | System determines appropriate panel based on query analysis |

## Journey Paths

### Path 1: Idea Refinement Journey
**Reference ID:** JOURNEY-IDEA-001

        Transition (Legal Gator) â†’ Due Diligence Preparation â†’ 
            Transition (Evaluation Chamber) â†’ Final Pitch Review â†’
                Exit with Investment Package
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Begins with critical pitch assessment
- Transitions to investment strategy planning
- Includes legal due diligence preparation
- Returns to Evaluation Chamber for final review
- Total estimated sessions: 3-6
- Primary output: Investment-ready pitch and materials

## Panel Transition Mechanics

Transitions between panels are critical moments in the user journey. The system facilitates these transitions through:

### User-Initiated Transitions
- **Direct Request:** User explicitly requests a different panel
- **Scenario Selection:** User selects a scenario that's better handled by another panel
- **Command Usage:** User employs specific transition commands (e.g., `/eval`, `/pathfind`, `/legal`)

### System-Initiated Transitions
- **Need Detection:** System detects a need that would be better served by another panel
- **Sequential Process:** Current panel completes its process and naturally hands off to the next panel
- **Cross-Panel Referral:** Panel member directly refers the user to another panel with specific handoff notes

### Transition Protocol

1. **Preparation:** Current panel summarizes progress and identifies specific needs for next panel
2. **Handoff:** System displays transition message with rationale and next steps
3. **Context Transfer:** Relevant context is transferred to the receiving panel
4. **Orientation:** New panel acknowledges previous work and establishes continuity
5. **Confirmation:** User confirms readiness to proceed with new panel

## Integration Points

These are specific moments where panels collaborate or share information:

### Synchronized Assessments
- **Evaluation + Pathfinder:** Combined product-market fit assessment
- **Legal + Evaluation:** Integrated risk-opportunity analysis
- **Pathfinder + Legal:** Strategic compliance planning

### Cross-Panel Dialogues
- **Panel Summits:** All three panels provide perspective on critical decisions
- **Expert Consultations:** One panel temporarily consults an expert from another panel
- **Handoff Discussions:** Explicit discussion between panels during transitions

### Shared Knowledge Repository
- Journey Memory maintains cross-panel awareness
- Previous panel insights remain accessible
- Contradictions between panel perspectives are highlighted and addressed

## Session Configuration Options

Users can configure their VALUGATOR sessions based on specific needs:

| Configuration | Description | Panels Involved |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Quick Evaluation | Rapid feedback on specific idea or feature | Evaluation Chamber only |
| Strategic Deep Dive | Comprehensive guidance on critical decisions | Pathfinder Council (primary), others as needed |
| Legal Risk Scan | Focused assessment of legal concerns | Legal Gator Panel only |
| Full Journey | Comprehensive support across all aspects | All panels, sequenced appropriately |
| Crisis Response | Urgent guidance for critical challenges | Starts with Pathfinder, transitions as needed |
| Innovation Session | Creative exploration of possibilities | Pathfinder Council + Evaluation Chamber |
| Compliance Check | Focused legal compliance verification | Legal Gator Panel + relevant specialists |

## Success Metrics

The effectiveness of multi-panel journeys is measured through:

1. **Transition Smoothness Rating:** User feedback on panel transition experience
2. **Cross-Panel Consistency:** Degree of alignment in guidance across panels
3. **Journey Completion Rate:** Percentage of users who complete their intended journey
4. **Time-to-Resolution:** Duration required to address the user's core need
5. **Value Perception:** User rating of value received from multi-panel experience
6. **Recommendation Actions:** Percentage of panel recommendations that users implement
7. **Return Rate:** Frequency of users returning for additional journeys
