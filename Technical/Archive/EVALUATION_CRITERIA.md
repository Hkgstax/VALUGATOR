## Scoring Methodology

### Quantitative Scoring
Each dimension receives numerical ratings on multiple scales:

1. **Overall Dimension Score**: 1-10 scale
   - 1-3: Significant weaknesses/concerns
   - 4-6: Moderate potential with notable issues
   - 7-8: Strong potential with minor concerns
   - 9-10: Exceptional potential with minimal concerns

2. **Sub-dimension Scores**: 1-5 scale
   - Allows more granular assessment of specific aspects
   - Highlights particular strengths or weaknesses within dimensions

3. **Confidence Rating**: 1-5 scale
   - Indicates how confident the gators are in their assessment
   - Lower confidence suggests areas needing validation or clarification

### Qualitative Assessment
Beyond numerical scores, each dimension includes:

1. **Key Strengths**: Specific positive aspects identified by gators
2. **Critical Concerns**: Major issues or challenges identified
3. **Validation Suggestions**: Recommended actions to test assumptions or validate approach
4. **Improvement Opportunities**: Specific suggestions for enhancing the idea

## Visualization Framework
