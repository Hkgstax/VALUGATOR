# Archived Technical Documentation

## Important Notice
**These documents have been archived and no longer represent the current state of the VALUGATOR project.**

## Reason for Archiving
In SESSION-004, VALUGATOR's scope was significantly expanded with the introduction of the Pathfinder Council. This expansion transformed VALUGATOR from a single-purpose evaluation tool into a comprehensive multi-panel system with different modes and interaction patterns.

The documents in this archive were created before this fundamental expansion and are based on the original, more limited scope:

- **USER_EXPERIENCE_JOURNEY.md**: Originally described a linear journey focused solely on pitch evaluation. With multiple panels and modes, the user experience is now much more complex and non-linear.

- **DIALOGUE_FLOW_PATTERNS.md**: Defined dialogue patterns only for evaluation scenarios. The addition of guidance-oriented dialogue from Pathfinders and legal advisory dialogue from the Legal Gator Panel requires completely different interaction patterns.

- **EVALUATION_CRITERIA.md**: Focused exclusively on idea evaluation metrics. The Pathfinder Council operates on entirely different principles focused on guidance rather than evaluation.

## Next Steps
These documents will be replaced with updated versions that account for VALUGATOR's expanded scope:

1. A new **MULTI-PANEL_USER_JOURNEYS.md** will define the various entry points, pathways, and transitions between different panels and modes.

2. A new **CROSS-PANEL_DIALOGUE_PATTERNS.md** will establish how characters from different panels interact with each other and the user across various contexts.

3. Panel-specific documents will define the unique interaction mechanisms for each panel:
   - **PATHFINDER_GUIDANCE_PATTERNS.md** for guidance-oriented interactions
   - **EVALUATION_CRITERIA.md** (updated) for evaluation-oriented interactions
   - **LEGAL_ADVISORY_PATTERNS.md** for legal guidance interactions
