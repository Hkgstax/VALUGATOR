# VALUGATOR: Technical Documentation

## Purpose
This directory contains technical specifications, architecture documents, and implementation details for the VALUGATOR platform. These documents define the system's technical requirements, component interactions, and development guidelines for this multi-panel AI guidance system.

## Audience
Software engineers, architects, and technical team members responsible for implementing the VALUGATOR system.
