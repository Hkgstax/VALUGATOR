## Purpose
VALUGATOR is an immersive, multi-mode AI experience where users engage with specialized panels of animated characters known as "Valugators" throughout their creative and development journey. The system adapts to different needs by configuring the right combination of Valugators for each situation.

The platform features three complementary councils that can be engaged individually or in powerful combinations:

1. **The Pathfinder Council**: A strategic guidance system that helps users navigate critical technical and business decisions. Pathfinders excel at scoping MVPs, defining technical architecture, evaluating trade-offs, optimizing resources, and breaking through obstacles when progress stalls. They transform complexity into clear action plans and keep development focused on high-impact priorities.

2. **The Evaluation Chamber**: An intensive critique environment where users present their ideas to expert personas who deliberate, challenge assumptions, and provide multi-perspective analysis on viability, feasibility, and growth potential. The Chamber delivers the rigorous feedback needed to identify critical improvements and prepare for real-world scrutiny.

3. **The Legal Gator Panel**: A specialized legal intelligence system covering intellectual property, contracts, compliance, corporate structure, and regulatory concerns. This panel identifies hidden risks, analyzes licensing issues, and provides strategic guidance on legal protection across multiple domains.

Users can activate different modes depending on their needs - from standalone council sessions to hybrid configurations where Valugators from different panels collaborate to address complex challenges. For example, Pathfinders can join Evaluation sessions to help process critique, or Legal Valugators can advise during technical planning.

All Valugators interact not just with the user but with each other, creating a dynamic multi-agent experience within a visual interface featuring avatars, speech bubbles, and personality-driven dialogue. This flexible, comprehensive approach makes VALUGATOR an indispensable companion for projects at any stage of development.

## Session Protocol
This project uses a structured documentation system to maintain context across planning sessions:

1. **Begin each new session** with:
   ```
   Resume project using DOCPROTOCOL. Last session ID: [SESSION-ID]
   ```
   Replace [SESSION-ID] with the ID from your previous session.

2. **End each session** with:
   ```
   Conclude session and prepare handoff
   ```
   This will update the session state and prepare documentation for the next session.

3. **First time starting**? Use:
   ```
   # DOCPROTOCOL: Claude will (1)Load system context from SESSION_STATE.md (2)Process new information (3)Update all affected documents (4)Maintain cross-references via unique IDs (5)Version all changes (6)Generate comprehensive session summary (7)Update knowledge graph (8)Prepare handoff state for next session
   ```

## Context Recovery Protocol
If you experience context loss or need to resume a session after interruption:

1. First, read the PROTOCOL.md file for core protocol instructions
2. Check SESSION_STATE.md for current session status and progress
3. Review the SESSION_PROTOCOL/SESSION_RECOVERY.md file for detailed recovery steps
4. Use this command to restore context:
   ```
   Resume project after context loss. Last session ID: [SESSION-ID]
   ```

> **Note for Claude**: Always check the CLAUDE_MUST_READ_THIS_FIRST directory first for essential protocol instructions.
