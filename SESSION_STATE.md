## Knowledge State
VALUGATOR is an immersive, session-based AI experience where users pitch their startup ideas to a panel of animated AI characters known as "gators." These gators represent distinct expert personas who engage in a dynamic, Shark Tankâ€“style critique session.

The core features include:
- Gator Personas with distinct roles and critique styles
- Speech Bubble Interface for visual dialogue presentation
- Multi-Agent Dialogue between gators and the user
- Structured Evaluation with scorecards and feedback
- Interactive Roleplay for user engagement
- Session Memory for tracking idea evolution
- Replay and Export functionality
- Optional Retrieval-Augmented Critique

Target audiences have been defined, including aspiring founders, solo builders, students and educators, accelerator programs, and content creators. Competitive advantages and success metrics have also been established.

In the current session, we've developed comprehensive gator personas with detailed personality traits, expertise areas, visual appearance descriptions, and interaction patterns. We've also established a structured evaluation framework with core dimensions, scoring methodology, and gator-specific evaluation patterns.
