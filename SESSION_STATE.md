## Knowledge State
VALUGATOR is an immersive, session-based AI experience where users interact with animated AI characters known as "gators" across multiple stages of their startup journey. The platform now includes multiple specialized gator panels serving different purposes: evaluation, legal guidance, and builder support.

The core features include:
- Diverse Gator Personas organized into specialized panels
- Speech Bubble Interface for visual dialogue presentation
- Multi-Agent Dialogue between gators and the user
- Structured Evaluation with scorecards and feedback
- Interactive Roleplay for user engagement
- Session Memory for tracking idea evolution
- Replay and Export functionality
- Optional Retrieval-Augmented Critique
- Multi-Panel User Journeys with different entry points and transition paths
- Cross-Panel Dialogue Patterns for seamless integration between panels

Target audiences have been defined, including aspiring founders, solo builders, students and educators, accelerator programs, and content creators. Competitive advantages and success metrics have also been established.

In SESSION-002, we developed comprehensive gator personas with detailed personality traits, expertise areas, visual appearance descriptions, and interaction patterns, as well as a structured evaluation framework with core dimensions, scoring methodology, and gator-specific evaluation patterns.

In SESSION-003, we completed the user experience design phase with a comprehensive journey map, dialogue flow patterns, and visual style guide.

In SESSION-004, we established:
- A comprehensive dual-license structure with proprietary and limited public viewing licenses
- Clear documentation of licensing terms and prohibited uses through LICENSE.txt, LICENSE_PUBLIC.txt, and NOTICE.md
- A specialized Legal Gator Panel with seven distinct legal personas focused on different domains:
  - Lex Talionis (IP enforcement)
  - Clara Clause (contract analysis)
  - Rana Regulus (regulatory compliance)
  - Gavin Graymark (corporate formation)
  - Delphi Docket (legal precedent)
  - Isla Proxy (platform terms)
  - Morven Sealight (international law)
- A new Pathfinder Council concept expanding VALUGATOR's scope beyond pitch evaluation to include builder support:
  - Guidance-Centered Interaction focused on illumination rather than judgment
  - Nine distinct Pathfinder personas with unique specializations:
    - Zane Cutter (MVP definition & reduction)
    - Luma Vale (purpose alignment)
    - Bram Hollowtide (emotional excavation & resilience)
    - Ori Verge (tradeoff calculus)
    - Echo of Then (hindsight foresight)
    - Vex Tanglecoil (embracing ambiguity)
    - Nell Foldbarrow (pattern interruption)
    - Sol Grasp (activation & decisiveness)
    - Dr. Vire Glint (assumption-testing)
  - Scenario-Based Guidance addressing common builder challenges

In SESSION-005, we developed:
- Comprehensive Multi-Panel User Journeys defining:
  - Multiple entry points based on user needs
  - Four detailed journey paths (Idea Refinement, Technical Implementation, Market Launch, Investment Readiness)
  - Panel transition mechanics between Evaluation Chamber, Pathfinder Council, and Legal Gator Panel
  - Session configuration options for different use cases
  - Success metrics for measuring multi-panel journey effectiveness
- Cross-Panel Dialogue Patterns establishing:
  - Core dialogue principles for maintaining coherence across panels
  - Three dialogue types (Handoff, Consultation, Summit) with structured formats
  - Panel-specific roles in cross-panel conversations
  - Perspective resolution framework for handling conflicting viewpoints
  - Knowledge transfer protocol for ensuring consistent information

This expansion transforms VALUGATOR from a pitch evaluation tool into a comprehensive startup journey companion, providing support for users across different phases of development, from ideation through building and pivoting, with a seamless experience across multiple specialized panels.
