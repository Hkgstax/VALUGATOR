## Knowledge State
VALUGATOR is an immersive, session-based AI experience where users pitch their startup ideas to a panel of animated AI characters known as "gators." These gators represent distinct expert personas who engage in a dynamic, Shark Tankâ€“style critique session.

The core features include:
- Gator Personas with distinct roles and critique styles
- Speech Bubble Interface for visual dialogue presentation
- Multi-Agent Dialogue between gators and the user
- Structured Evaluation with scorecards and feedback
- Interactive Roleplay for user engagement
- Session Memory for tracking idea evolution
- Replay and Export functionality
- Optional Retrieval-Augmented Critique

Target audiences have been defined, including aspiring founders, solo builders, students and educators, accelerator programs, and content creators. Competitive advantages and success metrics have also been established.

In SESSION-002, we developed comprehensive gator personas with detailed personality traits, expertise areas, visual appearance descriptions, and interaction patterns, as well as a structured evaluation framework with core dimensions, scoring methodology, and gator-specific evaluation patterns.

In SESSION-003, we have now completed:
- The comprehensive user experience journey map detailing all 8 key stages from onboarding through evaluation to follow-up
- Detailed dialogue flow patterns and interaction rules that govern conversations between gator characters
- A complete visual style guide establishing design principles for characters and interface elements

These deliverables complete the product definition phase and prepare us for technical architecture planning in SESSION-004.
