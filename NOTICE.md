## üö´ Specifically Prohibited Uses (Non-Exhaustive)

### 1. Copycats and Derivative Systems
- Building systems with similar multi-character evaluation panels  
- Recreating the critique dynamics, UI, or dialogue formats of VALUGATOR  
- Mimicking the scoring interface, persona archetypes, or startup evaluation metaphors  

### 2. Prompt Engineering or API Mimicry
- Using VALUGATOR's prompts or logic to build similar systems via LLMs  
- Reconstructing VALUGATOR mechanics using prompt chaining, API workflows, or agent orchestration  
- Attempting to replicate the experience using language model configuration  

### 3. Character Reproduction
- Repurposing gator-like characters or expert persona panels for similar use cases  
- Using VALUGATOR's character structures, dialogue style, or critique tone in any derivative setting  

### 4. AI Training & Embeddings
- Training or fine-tuning machine learning models on VALUGATOR content or outputs  
- Creating embeddings, datasets, or vector indexes from VALUGATOR materials  
- Building AI experiences derived from its language, structure, or prompts
