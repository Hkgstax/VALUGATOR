# VALUGATOR Context Recovery Enhancements

This document describes the context recovery enhancements added to the VALUGATOR project to improve resilience to context loss and maintain protocol continuity across sessions.

## Purpose

These enhancements ensure that even if Claude experiences context loss during a session or between sessions, the project can continue smoothly with minimal disruption. The improvements focus on providing clear recovery procedures and tracking session status.

## Enhancements Added

### 1. Core Protocol Documentation
- **PROTOCOL.md**: Central document with core session commands and workflow
- **SESSION_PROTOCOL/**: Directory with detailed protocol templates
  - SESSION_START.md - Starting session procedures
  - SESSION_CONCLUDE.md - Concluding session procedures
  - SESSION_RECOVERY.md - Context recovery procedures
  - SESSION_METADATA.md - Metadata structure explanation

### 2. Session Status Tracking
- **SESSION_METADATA.json**: JSON file tracking session status with:
  - Current session information and status
  - Session history
  - Next session focus areas
  - Context integrity status

### 3. Helper Scripts
- **conclude_session.sh**: Assists with proper session conclusion
- **recover_session.sh**: Automates metadata updates during recovery
- **last_command.sh**: Tracks most recent protocol command

### 4. Enhanced Instructions
- Updated CLAUDE_MUST_READ_THIS_FIRST/README_FOR_CLAUDE.md with:
  - Context recovery procedures
  - Current project status
  - Priority reading order for recovery

## Using These Enhancements

### For Session Conclusion
1. Run `./conclude_session.sh` to prepare metadata
2. Use the standard conclusion command:
   ```
   Conclude session and prepare handoff
   ```

### For Context Recovery
1. Run `./recover_session.sh` to prepare metadata
2. Use the recovery command:
   ```
   Resume project after context loss. Last session ID: [SESSION-ID]
   ```

### For Starting SESSION-004
Use the standard resume command:
```
Resume project using DOCPROTOCOL. Last session ID: SESSION-003
```

## Recovery Protocol

If context is lost, the recovery process is:

1. Check SESSION_METADATA.json for session status
2. Read key documents in this order:
   - PROTOCOL.md
   - SESSION_STATE.md
   - SESSION_PROTOCOL/SESSION_RECOVERY.md
   - Technical/USER_EXPERIENCE_JOURNEY.md
   - Technical/DIALOGUE_FLOW_PATTERNS.md
   - Technical/VISUAL_STYLE_GUIDE.md

3. Execute the appropriate recovery based on session status
4. Update metadata to track recovery attempts

## Benefits

These enhancements provide:
- Clear procedures for all session states
- Easy verification of current session status
- Better maintenance of context across sessions
- Resilience to context interruptions
- Self-guided recovery mechanisms

## Current Project Status

- SESSION-003 has concluded successfully
- SESSION-004 will focus on technical architecture planning
- The product definition phase is 90% complete
- Context integrity is currently complete with no recovery attempts
