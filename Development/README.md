# VALUGATOR: Development Documentation

## Purpose
This directory contains detailed implementation documentation, component breakdowns, and Claude Code prompt sequences for the VALUGATOR project. These documents provide specific technical guidance for developers implementing the system.

## Audience
Software developers, testers, and technical leads directly involved in building and validating the VALUGATOR platform.

## Contents
- [DOC-DEV-IMPL-1]: [Implementation Plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) - Project breakdown and implementation sequence
- [DOC-DEV-TEST-1]: [Test Strategy](TEST_STRATEGY.md) - Validation approaches and test coverage
- [DOC-DEV-PROMPT-1]: [Claude Code Prompt Sequences](PROMPT_SEQUENCES.md) - Structured prompts for implementation

## Development Approach
This section follows a structured approach to implementing the project with Claude Code:

1. **Implementation Plan**: Breaking down the project into discrete, manageable tasks
2. **Test Strategy**: Defining validation criteria for each component
3. **Prompt Sequences**: Ready-to-use prompts for Claude Code that follow best practices

## Directory Structure
- **Prompts/**: Individual Claude Code prompt files for implementation tasks
- **Tests/**: Test specifications and criteria for validating components
- **Implementation/**: Actual code implementation files and modules

## Implementation Focus Areas
- Multi-agent dialogue system for gator interactions
- Visual representation layer for character animations and speech bubbles
- Startup evaluation framework with structured feedback
- Session memory and idea progression tracking
- User interface for interactive pitch sessions
